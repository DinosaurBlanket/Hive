An experimental boardgame with two types of pieces:
	diagogs:  move diagonally across the board
	paragogs: move parallel or perpendicular to the edges of the board
Each piece has a range of 1-9.
On each turn, you can either move a piece, or split a piece.
When moving a piece, you can put it anywhere within range.
Landing on another piece will capture it and the captured pieces range
 will be transfered to the piece that captured it.
When you split a piece, you create a new piece adjacent to the original.
The new piece will get half of the original pieces range rounded down,
 and the original piece will be left with half of it's range rounded up.

The objective is to capture all of your opponents pieces.
